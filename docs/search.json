Parliaments and governments database (ParlGov): Information on parties, elections and cabinets in established democracies.\n\nparlgov.org\ndataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/parlgov\ngithub.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDöring, Holger. 2013. “The Collective Action of Data Collection: A Data Infrastructure on Parties, Elections and Cabinets.” European Union Politics 14(1): 161–78.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/1465116512461189\n[ presentation of technical concept ]\n\nDöring, Holger. 2016. “Mapping Established Democracies: Integrated Data on Parties, Elections and Cabinets.” Electoral Studies 44: 535–43.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.electstud.2016.07.002\n[ presentation of methodological design and operationalization ]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe include elections and cabinets in established democracies. More specifically, we include democratic national lower house elections and EP elections for all EU and most OECD members. For the latter, we exclude presidential systems. We record all elections and succeeding cabinets after 1945 or after full democratization according to Boix ea. (2013).\nWe also include elections and cabinets before 1945. We record information after 1900 or after the last democratic transition (Boix ea. 2013). As of today, these observations are experimental and may need revision (e.g. largest party with no seats missing).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe include parties winning more than 1.0% vote share in elections we cover\nDetails\n\nwinning 2 seats in an election (eg. member of an electoral alliance)\nparty groups that form in parliament\n\nmore than 5.0% seat share (eg. ITA FLI)\nforming in two parliamentary terms (eg. FRA GDR)\nmembers of cabinet (eg. SWE NP-AV)\nproviding minority support to a cabinet\n\nelectoral alliances and members with at least 2 election results\nno party affiliation\n\ncandidates with more than 1.0% vote share (eg. IRL I-TJM)\nincludes ‘independent’ (also for presidents)\none ‘no party affiliation’ included per country\n\nless than 1.0% vote share\n\nwinning 1 seat in 2 elections\n2 election results as largest party no seats (first loser)\n\nspecial categories: ‘no-seat’ and ‘one-seat’ (see election)\n\nWe avoid including minor parties or candidates that win a seat only in one election due to low threshold requirements.\n\n\n\nNew parties are coded in two tables: party change and party name change.\nMergers and party splits are only added as a new party if the (largest) predecessor party won less than 75% of the combined vote of all preceding parties in the last election. Otherwise the largest party is just renamed (cf. Döring 2016, 539).\nDetails\n\nsplits and re-mergers coded for original party (eg. JPN DP)\nsee also Barnea/Rahat (2011, 311): ‘a new label and that no more than half of its top candidates (top of candidate list or safe districts) originate from a single former party’\n\n\n\n\nParty names are sentence case if no national (language) convention requires title case.\n\neg. party names for Germany are title case (German and English)\n\nParty names and delimiters\n\n‘–’ different languages\n‘/’ (‘+’) alliances\n‘|’ generic names\n[ space before and after delimiter ]\n\nYear added to smaller party name if identical names exist in a country (eg. SVK SZ-92).\n\n\n\nWe provide aggregated party positions in four major dimensions. These positions are time-invariant unweighted mean values of information from party expert surveys on a 0 to 10 scale. All expert surveys are linked with ids from the party table and original values are rescaled before calculating the mean.\nMissing party positions for each dimension are imputed by mean values for the respective party family. We distinguish mean and imputed values by the number of decimal places. Mean values based on external datasets have five decimal places and imputed values have one decimal place only.\nVariables and sources\n\nleft/right — Castles/Mair 1983 (left/right), Huber/Inglehart 1995 (left/right), Benoit/Laver 2006 – (left/right), CHES 2010 (lrgen 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\nstate/market — Benoit/Laver 2006 (taxes/spending), CHES 2010 (lrecon 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\nliberty/authority — Benoit/Laver 2006 (social), CHES 2010 (galtan 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\nEU anti/pro — Ray 1999 (pos96), Benoit/Laver 2006 (euauthority or eulargerstronger or eujoining), CHES 2010 (position 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\n\n\n\n\nWe classify parties into families by their position in an economic (state/market) and a cultural (liberty/authority) left/right dimension.\nThe classification leads to eight party family categories: Communist/Socialist, Green/Ecologist, Social democracy, Liberal, Christian democracy, Agrarian, Conservative, Right-wing.\nParties that can not be classified into the eight categories are coded as ‘spec’ in the party table with more details in the party family table (e.g. AUT Martin). These are mainly special issue parties without a clear left/right profile.\nWe use one classification for the entire history of a party and do not record changes (e.g. FIN SP|P).\nWe add further information about party families in a separate table (see party family).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe include election results for\n\nall parties that won 1.0% vote share\nall parties that won 2 seats (esp. alliance members)\n\nDetails\n\na party that won less than 1.0% vote share and 1 seat\n\nseveral election results — included into the list of ParlGov parties\nsingle election result — coded as a ‘one-seat’ party (eg. Poland)\n\na party that won less than 1.0% vote share but was the largest party that won no seats (first loser)\n\nseveral election results — included into the list of ParlGov parties\nsingle election result — coded as a ‘no-seat’ party (eg.

Italy 1996)\nvotes are coded at the level of electoral results for all alliance members\nseats are coded for alliance members (parliamentary groups), if feasible\n\nseats of an alliance that forms a parliamentary group with members running independently are coded for alliance members and with a ‘parliament change’ (eg. Germany CDU/CSU)\nseats of alliance members are coded if no information about the parliamentary party group status is available\na ‘data_json’ entry ‘seats_alliance’ is added to the alliance to check data consistency\na ‘one seat’ party which is part of an electoral alliance is coded as an alliance member (eg. Hungary 2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges (&gt; 5%) in seats composition are recorded in ‘parliament change’\n\nesp. if changes affect cabinet majority support\n\nseats composition of parliament at a particular date is recorded in ‘parliament composition’\n\nesp. if composition is relevant for cabinet formation (eg.

Pre-election caretaker cabinets lasts for less and post-election cabinet for more than three months.\n\nfurther examples: AUT Gorbach II (1962), NLD Balkenende V (2010)\n\n\nDamgaard (1994: 194-95) and Müller/Strom (2000: 12) provide a more comprehensive discussion of cabinet definitions.\n\n\n\nCabinets with a limited legislative mandate (cf. McDonnell/Valbruzzi 2014, 664)\n\nnon-partisan: cabinet members without partisan affiliation\nprovisional: appointed post-transition cabinet\ntechnical: institutional reasons\ncontinuation: remaining in office (see ‘three month rule’ above)\n\nresignation of PM or cabinet\ndissolution of parliament\nafter election until new cabinet forms\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet status (minority, minimum winning or surplus majority) is determined only by the seat share of cabinet parties in parliament and not coded manually.\nIf there is an electoral alliance with separate seat shares but one of the parties is not a cabinet member, the cabinet will be treated as a minority cabinet (eg. UK 1951). Similarly, if any of the governing parties can be removed and the other governing parties still hold a majority in parliament, the cabinet is considered to be a surplus majority cabinet.\n\n\n\nExperimental version only — coding incomplete\nThe events that define a new cabinet are used to define the termination date. Cabinets may remain in office for a short period after the initial terminal event.

More specifically, we include democratic national lower house elections and EP elections for all EU and most OECD members. For the latter, we exclude presidential systems. We record all elections and succeeding cabinets after 1945 or after full democratization according to Boix ea. (2013).\nWe also include elections and cabinets before 1945. We record information after 1900 or after the last democratic transition (Boix ea. 2013). As of today, these observations are experimental and may need revision (e.g. largest party with no seats missing).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe include parties winning more than 1.0% vote share in elections we cover\nDetails\n\nwinning 2 seats in an election (eg. member of an electoral alliance)\nparty groups that form in parliament\n\nmore than 5.0% seat share (eg. ITA FLI)\nforming in two parliamentary terms (eg. FRA GDR)\nmembers of cabinet (eg. SWE NP-AV)\nproviding minority support to a cabinet\n\nelectoral alliances and members with at least 2 election results\nno party affiliation\n\ncandidates with more than 1.0% vote share (eg. IRL I-TJM)\nincludes ‘independent’ (also for presidents)\none ‘no party affiliation’ included per country\n\nless than 1.0% vote share\n\nwinning 1 seat in 2 elections\n2 election results as largest party no seats (first loser)\n\nspecial categories: ‘no-seat’ and ‘one-seat’ (see election)\n\nWe avoid including minor parties or candidates that win a seat only in one election due to low threshold requirements.\n\n\n\nNew parties are coded in two tables: party change and party name change.\nMergers and party splits are only added as a new party if the (largest) predecessor party won less than 75% of the combined vote of all preceding parties in the last election. Otherwise the largest party is just renamed (cf. Döring 2016, 539).\nDetails\n\nsplits and re-mergers coded for original party (eg. JPN DP)\nsee also Barnea/Rahat (2011, 311): ‘a new label and that no more than half of its top candidates (top of candidate list or safe districts) originate from a single former party’\n\n\n\n\nParty names are sentence case if no national (language) convention requires title case.\n\neg. party names for Germany are title case (German and English)\n\nParty names and delimiters\n\n‘–’ different languages\n‘/’ (‘+’) alliances\n‘|’ generic names\n[ space before and after delimiter ]\n\nYear added to smaller party name if identical names exist in a country (eg. SVK SZ-92).\n\n\n\nWe provide aggregated party positions in four major dimensions. These positions are time-invariant unweighted mean values of information from party expert surveys on a 0 to 10 scale. All expert surveys are linked with ids from the party table and original values are rescaled before calculating the mean.\nMissing party positions for each dimension are imputed by mean values for the respective party family. We distinguish mean and imputed values by the number of decimal places. Mean values based on external datasets have five decimal places and imputed values have one decimal place only.\nVariables and sources\n\nleft/right — Castles/Mair 1983 (left/right), Huber/Inglehart 1995 (left/right), Benoit/Laver 2006 – (left/right), CHES 2010 (lrgen 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\nstate/market — Benoit/Laver 2006 (taxes/spending), CHES 2010 (lrecon 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\nliberty/authority — Benoit/Laver 2006 (social), CHES 2010 (galtan 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\nEU anti/pro — Ray 1999 (pos96), Benoit/Laver 2006 (euauthority or eulargerstronger or eujoining), CHES 2010 (position 1999 and 2002 and 2006)\n\n\n\n\nWe classify parties into families by their position in an economic (state/market) and a cultural (liberty/authority) left/right dimension.\nThe classification leads to eight party family categories: Communist/Socialist, Green/Ecologist, Social democracy, Liberal, Christian democracy, Agrarian, Conservative, Right-wing.\nParties that can not be classified into the eight categories are coded as ‘spec’ in the party table with more details in the party family table (e.g. AUT Martin). These are mainly special issue parties without a clear left/right profile.\nWe use one classification for the entire history of a party and do not record changes (e.g. FIN SP|P).\nWe add further information about party families in a separate table (see party family).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe include election results for\n\nall parties that won 1.0% vote share\nall parties that won 2 seats (esp. alliance members)\n\nDetails\n\na party that won less than 1.0% vote share and 1 seat\n\nseveral election results — included into the list of ParlGov parties\nsingle election result — coded as a ‘one-seat’ party (eg.

Italy 1996)\nvotes are coded at the level of electoral results for all alliance members\nseats are coded for alliance members (parliamentary groups), if feasible\n\nseats of an alliance that forms a parliamentary group with members running independently are coded for alliance members and with a ‘parliament change’ (eg. Germany CDU/CSU)\nseats of alliance members are coded if no information about the parliamentary party group status is available\na ‘data_json’ entry ‘seats_alliance’ is added to the alliance to check data consistency\na ‘one seat’ party which is part of an electoral alliance is coded as an alliance member (eg. Hungary 2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges (&gt; 5%) in seats composition are recorded in ‘parliament change’\n\nesp. if changes affect cabinet majority support\n\nseats composition of parliament at a particular date is recorded in ‘parliament composition’\n\nesp. if composition is relevant for cabinet formation (eg.

Pre-election caretaker cabinets lasts for less and post-election cabinet for more than three months.\n\nfurther examples: AUT Gorbach II (1962), NLD Balkenende V (2010)\n\n\nDamgaard (1994: 194-95) and Müller/Strom (2000: 12) provide a more comprehensive discussion of cabinet definitions.\n\n\n\nCabinets with a limited legislative mandate (cf. McDonnell/Valbruzzi 2014, 664)\n\nnon-partisan: cabinet members without partisan affiliation\nprovisional: appointed post-transition cabinet\ntechnical: institutional reasons\ncontinuation: remaining in office (see ‘three month rule’ above)\n\nresignation of PM or cabinet\ndissolution of parliament\nafter election until new cabinet forms\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet status (minority, minimum winning or surplus majority) is determined only by the seat share of cabinet parties in parliament and not coded manually.\nIf there is an electoral alliance with separate seat shares but one of the parties is not a cabinet member, the cabinet will be treated as a minority cabinet (eg. UK 1951). Similarly, if any of the governing parties can be removed and the other governing parties still hold a majority in parliament, the cabinet is considered to be a surplus majority cabinet.\n\n\n\nExperimental version only — coding incomplete\nThe events that define a new cabinet are used to define the termination date. Cabinets may remain in office for a short period after the initial terminal event. The ‘description’ gives a short description of eventsthat led to the end of a cabinet.\n\n\n\nExperimental version only — coding incomplete\nConfidence votes are added for all recent cabinets but are not included for all cabinets in ParlGov.\n\ninvestiture (confidence) votes for new cabinets\nconfidence votes that lead to the termination of a cabinet\nimportant (won) confidence votes.\n\nDetails\n\ncabinet desription includes a brief entry for a confidence vote\nconstructive vote of no confidence\n\ncoded for outgoing cabinet (eg.

See table president.\n\n\n\nFor new cabinets and revisions of observations, we derive information about cabinet termination from news sources, preferably from the news agencies Reuters, AFP or the main national news agency\nFor West European countries we double checked our initial observations with the data in Müller/Strom (2000).
